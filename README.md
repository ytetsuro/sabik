Visualize source code complexity with Sabik.
This tool is to find the bad smell code.
I think your helpful refactoring.

# Basic Using

Please use Node.js >= 14.

If you use Node.js 14 or less, please use version 0.2.0.

```sh-session
$ npx sabik /target/path
```

## Local installation

If you felt sabik is slow, using local installation.

```sh-session
$ npm i -g sabik
```

### Using sabik with local installed

```sh-session
$ sabik /target/path
```

## Help

```sh-session
USAGE
  $ sabik [TARGET]

OPTIONS
  -h, --help                               show CLI help

  -o, --outputReportPath=outputReportPath  output report path.
                                                 For HTML, specify the directory, and for JSON, specify the file.

  -t, --outputFormat=(HTML|JSON)           [default: HTML] output report format. HTML or JSON. default: HTML

  -v, --version                            show CLI version

  --excludes=excludes                      [default: $^] exclude patterns. example: .test.ts$ .spec.ts$

  --matches=matches                        [default: .*] match patterns. example: .ts$
```

# What analyzable metrics?

Sabik analyzable metrics are following.

* Cyclomatic Complexity
* Cognitive Complexity
* Halstead complexity measures
* Line of Code(Logical, Physical)
* Maintainability

For now.

## Cyclomatic Complexity

Cyclomatic Complexity is metrics for linearly independent paths count.
Made Thomas McCabe.
High is bad, low is good metrics.
Higher when your code has a deep nest.
It’s very tiresome add test when over 8 scores. (In my experience)

If you want to know more about the detail, please see the following.

[CyclomaticComplexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity)


## Cognitive Complexity

Cognitive Complexity is metrics for human readability.
Made SonarSource inc.
High is bad, low is good metrics.
Higher when your code has a deep nest.
It’s read very hard when over 8 scores. (In my experience)

If you want to know more about the detail, please see the following.

[CognitiveComplexity](https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf)

## Halstead complexity measures

Halstead complexity measures are metrics for a difficulty to understand.
Made Maurice Howard Halstead.
High is bad, low is good metrics.
Higher when your code has many responsibilities.
These metrics are judge difficulty from vocabulary size, for example, the newspaper is difficult but, children's book is easy to understand.

If you want to know more about the detail, please see the following.

[Halstead complexity measures](http://www.virtualmachinery.com/sidebar2.htm)

## Line of Code(Logical, Physical)

Physical Line of Code is metrics for line count include comments.
Logical Line of Code is metrics for line count ignored comments.
High is bad, low is good metrics.

## Maintainability

Maintainability is metric for software maintainability.
Made Microsoft inc.
Low is bad, High is good metrics.
This metric ranges from 0 ~ 100.
It’s maintenance hard when under 60 scores. (In my experience)

If you want to know more about the detail, please see the following.
